# SuikaBlog

Welcome to SuikaBlog! This is the repository for the SuikaBlog project, a blogging platform. You can access the main page of SuikaBlog [here](https://twinisland.github.io/SuikaBlog/).

## Test Server

To test SuikaBlog, we provide a test server that is driven by `express`. Here's how you can set it up:

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the test server by running:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

The test server is built using `zig/zap`, so you don't need to worry about dealing with any npm-related stuff. It's a convenient way to preview and test SuikaBlog during development.

## Under Development

Please note that SuikaBlog is currently under development. We are actively working on improving and adding features to make it a great blogging platform. Feel free to contribute or provide feedback to help us make it even better.

Thank you for checking out SuikaBlog!

This updated README.md provides clear instructions on setting up and testing the project, along with a note about its current development status.
